# Algorithm implementations for Geometric Algorithms course at AGH UST

This repository contains implementations and detailed PDF reports (in Polish) of various geometric algorithms.

## Technologies

- Programming language: *Python 3.9*
- Graphics libraries: *[Environment prepared by BIT](https://github.com/aghbit/Algorytmy-Geometryczne)*
- Development environment: *Jupyter Notebook*

## Algorithms
1. [Basic Geometric Predicats](lab01)
2. [Convex Hull Algorithms - Graham, Jarvis](lab02)
3. [Y-Monotonic Triangulation](lab03)
4. [Line Segment Intersection](lab04)

## Conclusions

Each lab concludes with a summary of observations and findings derived from the exercises and their implications for understanding geometric algorithms.

Please refer to individual lab folders for more detailed information on each exercise and the corresponding reports.
